## Hi there 👋 <br />
⚡I'm a student📕 from Bavaria🥨. <br />
🤔 Because of that, I'm only a half-time full-stack developer👨‍💻. <br />
🔭 I’m working for a small insurance company developing some data structuring systems, mainly in Java. <br />
🌱 Also, I have knowledge of web development and some basic C/C++ skills. <br />
📫 How to reach me: You can contact me any time by writing an email to dominic.bachl@icloud.com. <br />
💬 I always appreciate help as well as criticism on my code. Nobody is perfect. <br />
